# OOP Dev Data Card Generator
---

### Used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in pure JavaScript to read developer data from a JSON file and dynamically displaying them on a webpage as developer cards with all the details from the .json file


## 🚀 Installation
---
### Installing npm Packages

To update to the latest version of **npm**, run:  
 ```bash```

```npm install -g npm```

### Check if Node.js and npm are installed, and view their versions:

```node -v```
```npm -v```


### Using a Node Version Manager

A Node version manager allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm. This is useful for testing your applications across different versions.

macOS / Linux: use nvm

Windows: use nodist
 or nvm-windows

Using a Node Installer

If you prefer not to use a version manager, you can install Node.js and npm directly:

Linux: use the NodeSource installer
 (recommended)

macOS / Windows: download the LTS version from the official Node.js website

Other systems: either use NodeSource (preferred) or download from the Node.js site
